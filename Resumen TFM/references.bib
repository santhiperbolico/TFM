    abstract = "{The Press—Schechter, excursion set approach allows one to make predictions about the shape and evolution of the mass function of bound objects. The approach combines the assumption that objects collapse spherically with the assumption that the initial density fluctuations were Gaussian and small. The predicted mass function is reasonably accurate, although it has fewer high-mass and more low-mass objects than are seen in simulations of hierarchical clustering. We show that the discrepancy between theory and simulation can be reduced substantially if bound structures are assumed to form from an ellipsoidal, rather than a spherical, collapse. In the original, standard, spherical model, a region collapses if the initial density within it exceeds a threshold value, ?sc. This value is independent of the initial size of the region, and since the mass of the collapsed object is related to its initial size, this means that ?sc is independent of final mass. In the ellipsoidal model, the collapse of a region depends on the surrounding shear field, as well as on its initial overdensity. In Gaussian random fields, the distribution of these quantities depends on the size of the region considered. Since the mass of a region is related to its initial size, there is a relation between the density threshold value required for collapse and the mass of the final object. We provide a fitting function to this ?ec(m) relation which simplifies the inclusion of ellipsoidal dynamics in the excursion set approach. We discuss the relation between the excursion set predictions and the halo distribution in high-resolution N-body simulations, and use our new formulation of the approach to show that our simple parametrization of the ellipsoidal collapse model represents an improvement on the spherical model on an object-by-object basis. Finally, we show that the associated statistical predictions, the mass function and the large-scale halo-to-mass bias relation, are also more accurate than the standard predictions.}",

    abstract = "{The backbone of standard cosmology is the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker solution to Einstein’s equations of general relativity (GR). In recent years, observations have largely confirmed many of the properties of this model, which are based on a partitioning of the universe’s energy density into three primary constituents: matter, radiation and a hypothesized dark energy which, in ? cold dark matter (?CDM), is assumed to be a cosmological constant ?. Yet with this progress, several unpalatable coincidences (perhaps even inconsistencies) have emerged along with the successful confirmation of expected features. One of these is the observed equality of our gravitational horizon Rh(t0) with the distance ct0 light has travelled since the big bang, in terms of the current age t0 of the universe. This equality is very peculiar because it need not have occurred at all and, if it did, should only have happened once (right now) in the context of ?CDM. In this paper, we propose an explanation for why this equality may actually be required by GR, through the application of Birkhoff’s theorem and the Weyl postulate, at least in the case of a flat space–time. If this proposal is correct, Rh(t) should be equal to ct for all cosmic time t, not just its present value t0. Therefore, models such as ?CDM would be incomplete because they ascribe the cosmic expansion to variable conditions not consistent with this relativistic constraint. We show that this may be the reason why the observed galaxy correlation function is not consistent with the predictions of the standard model. We suggest that an Rh=ct universe is easily distinguishable from all other models at large redshift (i.e. in the early universe), where the latter all predict a rapid deceleration.}",

	Abstract = {Our current knowledge of cosmic star-formation history during the first two billion years (corresponding to redshift z > 3) is mainly based on galaxies identified in rest-frame ultraviolet light1. However, this population of galaxies is known to under-represent the most massive galaxies, which have rich dust content and/or old stellar populations. This raises the questions of the true abundance of massive galaxies and the star-formation-rate density in the early Universe. Although several massive galaxies that are invisible in the ultraviolet have recently been confirmed at early epochs2--4, most of them are extreme starburst galaxies with star-formation rates exceeding 1,000 solar masses per year, suggesting that they are unlikely to represent the bulk population of massive galaxies. Here we report submillimetre (wavelength 870 micrometres) detections of 39 massive star-forming galaxies at z > 3, which are unseen in the spectral region from the deepest ultraviolet to the near-infrared. With a space density of about 2 ×10−5 per cubic megaparsec (two orders of magnitude higher than extreme starbursts5) and star-formation rates of 200 solar masses per year, these galaxies represent the bulk population of massive galaxies that has been missed from previous surveys. They contribute a total star-formation-rate density ten times larger than that of equivalently massive ultraviolet-bright galaxies at z > 3. Residing in the most massive dark matter haloes at their redshifts, they are probably the progenitors of the largest present-day galaxies in massive groups and clusters. Such a high abundance of massive and dusty galaxies in the early Universe challenges our understanding of massive-galaxy formation.},
